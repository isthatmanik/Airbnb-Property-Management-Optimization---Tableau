# Airbnb Property Management Optimization

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings aimed at optimizing rental strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue for property owners. The project leverages Airbnbâ€™s dataset to provide insights on pricing, demand trends, and customer preferences, with results visualized through a Tableau dashboard for actionable decision-making.

## Problem Statement
As a Data Analyst at Airbnb, the objective of this project is to generate valuable insights from Airbnb's dataset, helping both Airbnb and property hosts improve decision-making through optimized rental strategies, enhanced customer satisfaction, and increased host revenue.

## Analysis Goals

Prepare Tableau Calculations and Analysis for the Following:
1. **Neighborhood Popularity and Pricing**: Identify high-demand areas and analyze how pricing varies across different locations.
2. **Property Type Distribution**: Examine the demand for various property types (e.g., entire homes, private rooms).
3. **Customer Satisfaction and Ratings**: Analyze the relationship between listing prices and review ratings to uncover factors driving customer satisfaction.
4. **Seasonality and Booking Trends**: Track booking trends throughout the year to identify seasonal demand patterns.
5. **Host and Listing Analysis**: Determine which hosts have the most listings and compare their pricing strategies.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes columns with information on:
- Property characteristics (e.g., type, location)
- Host details
- Pricing information
- Customer reviews and ratings

### Key Questions Explored
1. What is the price distribution across different neighborhoods?
2. How does the availability of different room types vary by neighborhood?
3. What trends exist in host activity and review patterns?
4. How does room availability and booking fluctuate seasonally?
5. Does construction year impact price or listing popularity?

## Insights Summary

1. **Neighborhood Popularity**: Manhattan and Brooklyn lead in listings, while Bronx and Staten Island have lower demand.
2. **Pricing Trends**: High pricing is concentrated in select Manhattan areas; prices range from $54 to $1,045.
3. **Room Availability**: Staten Island has the highest availability; Manhattan and Brooklyn face higher demand.
4. **Customer Satisfaction**: Price has minimal impact on review ratings, with an extremely weak correlation (-0.0046).
5. **Seasonal Trends**: Bookings peak in June, while demand decreases steadily through winter months.

## Recommendations

1. **Target High-Demand Areas**: Focus on Manhattan and Brooklyn for higher returns.
2. **Competitive Pricing**: Adjust pricing based on local trends, especially in premium areas.
3. **Flexible Booking Options**: Consider instant booking and flexible minimum night policies to attract diverse guests.
4. **Property Variety**: Diversify property types (e.g., private rooms and entire homes) to meet different guest preferences.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring data quality for accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to support strategic decisions for Airbnb and hosts.
